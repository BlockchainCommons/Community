# Available Tasks

These are items originally from [Shannon's TODO](TODO-Shannon.md) that can likely be done by others. I've added explanations Ask me on Signal or at shannon.appelcline@gmail.com if you need more info on anything.

If you take on something and finish it, please check it off.

## Web/Repo Tasks

1. * [ ] Check Projects page for essential updates https://www.blockchaincommons.com/projects.html (save bigger changes for later)

_Basically, go over the page to see if it's up-to-date. Change descriptions or names as required; remove anything that never happened; and add our most notable new projects._

1. * [ ] Add App Icons to WWW Projects Page

_We've now got icons for all of our iOS Apps, courtesy of Wolf. They should be added to the appropriate entries on the Projects page, probably as a align='right' img, of an appropriate size (maybe 100-200 px?)_

_All images are at https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/tree/master/Images/logos._

1. * [ ] Link apps to various places like:
     * [ ] Youtube video descripts (Wolf's)
     * [ ] Main Page
     * [ ] Other Places?

_The idea here is to better publicize Gordian Seed Tool, Gordian QR Tool, and in the future other apps. They can probably be linked from the description of our videos, and maybe from other places in our repos and on our main web page._

1. * [ ] Write "expand the ideas of responsible key management and self-determination on the internet" into main web pages & repos

_Add this language to the main web page and/or repo pages, as appropriate._

1. * [ ] Add "<div class="bold--excerpt--node">Read More</div>" to all older posts.

_At some point we replaced:_
```
<!--more-->
```
_In our front page posts with:_
```
div class="bold--excerpt--node">Read More</div>

<!--more-->
```
_All of the older posts where this wasn't done need to similarly be updated._

## Writing Tasks

1. * [ ] Write UR/PSBT Article

_We've got a nice set of UR articles [here](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md#more-documents). We need a PSBT article that talks about how UR PSBTs work, with examples, in the same style and general organization as the Key Material and SSKR articles._

1. * [ ] Add PSBTs to Request/Response

_Once we've got a PSBT article done, we will also need to add a PSBT section to the Request/Response UR article [here](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-99-request-response.md)._

## Video Tasks

1. * [ ] Input Graphics for Long Seedtool Video

_We need to produce a long video demonstrating Seed Tool. This requires use of [Descript](https://www.descript.com/)._

_There is a [script](https://hackmd.io/yb2ut3w6QyOsAqb1x_UeOA?both#Seed-Tool-Longer-Video-3-5-minutes-YouTube) already written. It should be recorded by Wolf or Chris, since I believe they both have voices stored with Descript._

_After that, the large task is embedding images to go with the video. The largely completed long QR Tool video in our project workspace shows the approximate methodology. There's an image every line or two of text, overlapping with fades. (You might come up with a better way to shift between the images. There are also zooms and such not used in that sample, so go wild and create something that looks nice.) We've settled on 1920x1080 as the best size for this format._
