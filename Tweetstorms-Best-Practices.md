## General Style

* Include good photo, gif, or social preview on first tweet
   * A link to our repos should generally produce a prepared social preview
      * If there's not a social-media preview for a repo we want to link, we should create it
* Make sure you introduce project for someone who's never seen it before
* Be sure to link to the repo for the project you're talking about
   * You might also link to READMEs, docs, or other files, especially if you're talking about them specifically, or they've been recently created or updated
* Provide photos, images, links and/or social previews on other tweets as possible
   * 50% or more is a good ratio
      * Possibly include images, usually found in `images` or `Images` of repo
      * Possibly link to different files in repo
      * Possibly link to www.blockchaincommons.com
      * Possibly link to relevent research papers: https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research
      * Possibly link master repos for [crypto-commons](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons), [Gordian](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian), and [torgap](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap)
      * Probaly link to developer communities (see below)
* Connect developers back to our communities & encourage testing and participation.
