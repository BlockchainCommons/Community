## General Style

* Include good photo, gif, or social preview on first tweet
   * A link to our repos should generally produce a prepared social preview
      * If there's not a social-media preview for a repo we want to link, we should create it
* Make sure you introduce project for someone who's never seen it before
* Be sure to link to the repo for the project you're talking about
   * You might also link to READMEs, docs, or other files, especially if you're talking about them specifically, or they've been recently created or updated
* Provide photos, images, links and/or social previews on other tweets as possible
   * 50% or more is a good ratio
      * Possibly include images, usually found in `images` or `Images` of repo
      * Possibly link to different files in repo
      * Possibly link to www.blockchaincommons.com
      * Possibly link to relevent research papers: https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research
      * Possibly link master repos for [crypto-commons](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons), [Gordian](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian), and [torgap](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap)
      * Probaly link to developer communities (see below)
* Connect developers back to our communities & encourage testing and participation.
   * AirGapped Wallet Discussions: https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions or https://tinyurl.com/airgap-disc
   * Blockchain Commons Community: https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community
* Appeal to become patrons
   * Our creators may not be comfortable with this, in which case this can be covered in the RT:
   * Blockchain Commons GitHub Sponsors: https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons
   * Blockchain Commons BTCPay: https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/
* Obviously: remember 280 characters max per tweet
* Number the tweets if it's a storm: [X/Y]
* Log It!
   * Link to your tweet at: https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/blob/master/Tweetstorms.md
 
### Sample Appeals to Community

_These are drawn from existing tweets, so some are very specific to certain topics._

> Blockchain Commons is not endowed, nor does it have any notable supply of bitcoins. We're running month to month with support from patrons.
>
> The more support we have, the more we can do, and the less we have, the less we can do. If you'd like to support our increased work,  consider becoming a GitHub patron. https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons

> Please support this course so that we can add teaching how to use the Lightning Network via the CLI, and more advanced topics like miniscript. Support the course by becoming an ongoing patron at https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons, starting at $20 a month.

### Sample Appeals to Patrons

_These are drawn from existing tweets, so some are very specific to certain topics._

> We're looking forward to releasing our new #SmartCustody document, but in the meantime we'd love to hear your thoughts on the design of multisigs, either here or in our Wallet discussion community. https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions

> If you're a developer, we'd love to have your input on this work, so that we can push on additional features that will support everyone. Please join us in Blockchain Commons' Airgapped Wallet Community. https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions

#### List the Sponsors!

If we appeal to new sponsors, we should list our current ones.

This currently reads something like the following:

```
Thanks to current sustaining sponsors Bitmark (@BitmarkInc), Unchained Capital (@unchainedcap), and Blockchainbird (@henkvancann). [14/14]
```
