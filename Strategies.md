# Blockchain Commons Strategies

1. **Blockchain Commons:** Create a specific commons that is dedicated to the realization of open infrastructure for secure, compassionate, decentralized systems.
   - Decide the boundaries, scale, and affordances of a commons that advance open infrastructure for decentralized systems.
   - Define and promote equitable business practices, including contracts and licenses, for sustainable wealth creation for both individual practitioners and organizations.
   - Gather resources, e.g., capabilities, intellectual property, funding, and people, to advance and sustain the realization of decentralized systems.
   - Lobby for secure, compassionate[[k\]](#cmnt11) decentralized systems. Ensure that emerging policy and regulatory decisions enable and support decentralized approaches to credentials and identity.
1. **Open Infrastructure:** Define and advocate a specific and actionable notion of “open infrastructure” as a self-organizing approach to collaborative resource generation.
   - Establish an affirmative definition of open infrastructure that provides a framework for regenerative, self-organizing complex systems that can be drawn upon for deep wealth.
   - Define a language for discussing, and advocating for, open infrastructure.
   - Discover best practices for defining boundaries, scale, and affordances of shared commons.
   - Help governments support open infrastructure and avoid laws & regulations that undermine it.
1. **Architecture:** Research, define, and evangelize an interoperable architecture for secure decentralized systems that are resilient, pragmatic, and easy to use.
   - Create and maintain a shared risk model that addresses adversarial incentives, forces of nature, and operational resiliency.
   - Establish systems of incentives and obstacles against centralized rent-seeking, bad actors, invisible architectures, and other systemic risks.
   - Build reference code and research platform for cryptocurrencies, decentralized identity, and related components of secure decentralized systems.
   - Distill and champion the benefits of secure decentralized systems compared to centralized solutions.
1. **Demand:** Define and advocate a new techno-social contract of decentralized infrastructure, based on human dignity, respect for the individual, and mutual benefit for all contributors.
   - Advocate tools and processes that secure interactions and empower individuals without dependence on trusted third parties.
   - Stimulate demand for, a culture of, and support for secure decentralized systems.
   - Develop, capture, distill, and promote best practices in secure decentralized systems in simple, actionable, understandable terms.
1. **Peers:** Increase the demand for, and population of, people who understand the effective development, and use of, secure decentralized systems.
   1. Create a vibrant, collaborative community of at least 6000 professionals engaged in conversation about advancing open infrastructure for decentralized systems.
   1. Develop a pedagogy and offer a curriculum for practitioners, including internship and externship programs.
   1. Create a cadre of stewards who collaborate to support open infrastructure for decentralized systems, both within and outside the organization.
   1. Recruit, engage and empower diverse perspectives and experiences to realize effective, secure decentralized systems.
