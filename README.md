# Blockchain Commons Community

The Blockchain Commons Community is a central location for discussion and information dispersal for Blockchain Commons stakeholders.

## Objectives

1. **Blockchain Commons:** Create a specific commons that is dedicated to the realization of open infrastructure for secure, compassionate, decentralized systems.
1. **Open Infrastructure:** Define and advocate a specific and actionable notion of “open infrastructure” as a self-organizing approach to collaborative resource generation.
1. **Architecture:** Research, define, and evangelize an interoperable architecture for secure decentralized systems that are resilient, pragmatic, and easy to use.
1. **Demand:** Define and advocate a new techno-social contract of decentralized infrastructure, based on human dignity, respect for the individual, and mutual benefit for all contributors.
1. **Peers:** Increase the demand for, and population of, people who understand the effective development, and use of, secure decentralized systems.

If you are interested in supporting a specific blockchain FOSS (free and open-source software) project, feature, or bug bounty, or wish to support the Blockchain Commons or open infrastructure in general, please [become an ongoing sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons) or if you prefer [make a donation to our BTCPay](https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/). We are investigating non-profit options (such as working with the Human Rights Founding) but we are not a charitable non-profit at this time, so any contributions are not individually tax-deductible; however, any contributions by businesses are tax-deductible as an expense. See https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons for details.

## Learning Resources

- [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line) — The best way to learn to learn deeply about bitcoin is to avoid GUIs (even bitcoin-qt), and instead learn it from the command line.
- [#SmartCustody](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook) — The Use of Advanced Cryptographic Tools to Improve the Care, Maintenance, Control, and Protection of Digital Assets

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian System Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions). For users and developers of the Gordian system, including the Gordian Server, Bitcoin Standup technology, QuickConnect, and the Gordian Wallet. If you want to talk about our linked full-node and wallet technology, suggest new additions to our Bitcoin Standup standards, or discuss the implementation our standalone wallet, the Discussions area of the [main Gordian repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) is the place.

[**Wallet Standard Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about wallet standards, please use the Discussions area of the [Airgapped Signing repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning). This is where you can talk about projects like our [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) and command line tools such as [seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli), both of which are intended to testbed wallet technologies, plus the libraries that we've built to support your own deployment of wallet technology such as [bc-bip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [bc-slip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Shamir Secret Key Recovery](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur), and the [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base). If it's a wallet-focused technology or a more general discussion of wallet standards,discuss it here.

[**Blockchain Commons Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions). For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than the [Gordian System](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions) or the [wallet standards](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions), each of which have their own discussion areas.

### Other Questions & Problems

As an open-source, open-development community, Blockchain Commons does not have the resources to provide direct support of our projects. Please consider the discussions area as a locale where you might get answers to questions. Alternatively, please use this repository's [issues](./issues) feature. Unfortunately, we can not make any promises on response time.

If your company requires support to use our projects, please feel free to contact us directly about options. We may be able to offer you a contract for support from one of our contributors, or we might be able to point you to another entity who can offer the contractual support that you need.

## Community RoadMap

- [x] Create Github Community
  - [ ] Review content with members & patrons
- [x] We need a CONTRIBUTING.md, something along the lines of [ParticipatoryOrgs-Community/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ParticipatoryOrgs/ParticipatoryOrgs-Community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) & [ipfs/contributing.md](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/contributing.md)
  - [ ] Review content with members & patrons
  - [x] We need a Contributors Agreement (pending legal formation)
- [x] Create website for blockchaincommons.com, maybe blockchaincommons.org (ChristopherA currently holds these domains)
- [ ] Legal formation
  - [ ] Investigate legal formation options (LLC, L4C, etc.) and legal venues (US, Deleware, Wyoming, overseas,etc.)
  - [ ] Investigate a formal relationship with [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) for those US patrons who wish to contribute tax-deductible funds.
- [ ] Funding
  - [ ] Submit proposals to various foundations desiring to support commons activities

## Status — Varied

Please read the statuses in individual repos. Many projects are still in testing phase and should not be used for production tasks until they have had further testing and auditing.

## Responsible Disclosure

We want to keep all of our software safe for everyone. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. We are unfortunately not able to offer bug bounties at this time.

We do ask that you offer us good faith and use best efforts not to leak information or harm any user, their data, or our developer community.

We promise not to bring legal action against researchers who point out a problem provided they do their best to follow the these guidelines.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name              | Fingerprint                                        |
