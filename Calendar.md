# Blockchain Calendar Dates

The following days are among the days that are the most important to the concepts of Gordian. They're the dates that we currently put **Gordian Seed Tool** on sale (current Best Practice is to start the sale the day before and end it the day after to make sure we hit the day in question).

* **January 3: Bitcoin Genesis Block.** This was the day that the Bitcoin Genesis Block was released, in 2009. It's probably our best "official holiday" for blockchains.
* **March 31: World Backup Day.** This is a day that reminds us to backup our data. It's a good day to remind people about the importance of #SmartCustody and programs such as **Gordian Seed Tool**.
* **July 4: US Independence Day.** Independence is one of the Gordian Principles, so it's a great day to talk about the fact that the Gordian independence is meant to give you financial independence.
* **October 31: Bitcoin White Paper.** The Bitcoin White Paper was released to a cryptography mailing list on October 31, 2008, so this is the second optionf or Bitcoin's birthday, though most people prefer January 3. We can extend this holiday by one day to also include **November 1** as "Day of the Dead", when we remember to test our backups that our digital holdings become available to our heirs.

Other days that could be used for announcements or sales include:

* **January 28: Data Privacy Day.**
* **August 1: Bitcoin Independence Day.** This was the day of the initiation of the [UASF for SegWit](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-independence-day-how-this-watershed-day-defines-community-consensus). It was called "Bitcoin Independence Day" for a few days afterward. It's unclear if anyone is still noting this day, or if they've moved on.
