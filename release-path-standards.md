# Best Practice Stands for Release Path
We are in the process of creating best-practice standards for the Blockchain Commons [release path](release-path.md). We use as our inspiration, the [Core Infrastructure Best Practices badge](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge) and other similar systems.
What follows if our first-cut look at what standards we would like products to meet as they advance along the release path. We omit some from sources like Core Infrastructure (such as the need for a stable website and the ability to report bugs) because we believe the requirements our implicit in our use of GitHub.

*Research:*
   * _none currently_
   
*Alpha:*
   * Have working build
   * Include Full attribution
   * Post Open license
   
*Late Alpha:*
   * Write Basic installation & usage instructions
   
*Beta:*
   * Acknowledge issues & PRs
   * Add static analysis tools to test suite
   * Complete Website (or GitHub) so it says what the product does and where to get it

*Feature-Complete:*
   * Complete security reviews

*Final:*
   * Begin versioning releases
   * Fix vulnerabilities within 60 days

_At this time, this listing is very incomplete; additions and comments are very welcome. Ultimately, we would like any "Final:" program to approach or entirely meet standards like those in the Core Infrastructure best Practices._
