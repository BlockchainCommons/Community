# Info Website Conventions

This page covers standard conventions for setting up exemplar websites, such as our .info websites at [Lifehash.info](https://lifehash.info/) and [Seedtool.info](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool.info).

## Standard Text

The following standard text should be applied to the website if it applies, usually at the bottom of the front page, so that it's visible, but not obstructive to the main purpose of the site. It should be placed with the Blockchain Commons logo (currently v3) with the suggestion of the logo going to the left, as shown below.

You can align-left the picture in GitHub:

<img src="images/logos/bc-logo-black.png" height=150 align="left"><hr><i>This site is a proof-of-concept. It is intended to demonstrate the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles">Principles</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/README.md">Gordian Architecture</a>. Use at your own risk. For more info on this site, please see its <a href="LINK-TO-REPO">repo</a>. For more info on Blockchain Commons, please see our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/">main web page</a>. If you'd like to become a sponsor of work like this, please visit our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">Sponsors Page</a>.</i><hr>

For a non GitHub page you may need to change the align-left to float-left for correct flow:

<img src="images/logos/bc-logo-black.png" height=150 style="float: left"><hr><i>This site is a proof-of-concept. It is intended to demonstrate the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles">Principles</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/README.md">Gordian Architecture</a>. Use at your own risk. For more info on this site, please see its <a href="LINK-TO-REPO">repo</a>. For more info on Blockchain Commons, please see our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/">main web page</a>.
